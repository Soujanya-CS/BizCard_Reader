# BizCard_Reader
a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pincode. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI).
